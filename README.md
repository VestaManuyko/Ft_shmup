A group project with another 42 student over the weekend. A small shooting game! 2 version possible by running "Make run" for 1 option, simple style arrows for movement of the player, space for shooting, basic spawning of shooting enemies. For 2 option (the cooler one) "Make bonus". This option needs a bigger screen for playing. 2 player mode available, arrows for movement and "0 button" on the left side of the keyboard for player 1, WASD and space for shooting for player 2. Added colouring and different type of enemies, V for normal-1 life enemie that shoots, #- 2 life obstacle, @ - 100 life obstacle, $ when catching a dollar sign a life adds to the player, after having 10 lives adds score up.
